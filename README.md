### Need to improve 
1. In view of the time constraints, some features such as saving bookshelf data have been omitted. As a result, when users return to the app, they will not be able to access their saved bookshelves.
2. The app lacks user login/register functionality to differentiate new and existing users, and it also does not provide a password setting feature.
